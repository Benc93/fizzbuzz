fizzbuzz
========

Lesson 1 - Week 1

-Downloaded & installed rspec.
-Built a fizzbuzz program with accompanying rspec file.
-Debugged, and discussed various points and common conventions (eg, hard code the ruby method to initially 'test' the test script)
-Passed an rspec test for the following:
if a number is/is not divisible by 3
if a number is/is not divisible by 7
then
if a method returns "Fizz" if a number is divisible by 3
if a method returns "Buzz" if a number is divisible by 5 
if a method returns "FizzBuzz" if a number is divisible by 15
if a method returns the original number if it is NOT divisible by 3; 5; or 15.
