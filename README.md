##Makers Academy: Week 1, Lesson 1 (Fizzbuzz)

####Summary of Activity  
    
This was the first taught lesson at Makers Academy and it introduced one new concept: *Test Driven Development.*
   
Fizzbuzz is something of a programming institution (a fact I was oblivious to at the time!), but the lesson was there to break the ice on Day 1 with some familiar Ruby syntax, whilst introducing the idea of writing unit tests, failing them, passing them, and refactoring:

This task played out as follows: 
+ Creating a Project Directory locally, a new GitHub repo, and linking the two together.   
+ Installing RSpec.  
+ Creating a spec folder, and a fizzbuzz_spec file. 
+ Writing simple tests, running RSpec to see the failed test, then writing the production code to pass them. 
+ Refactoring existing methods. 
+ Eventually reaching a point where the FizzBuzz functionality is complete. 
+ Commiting each completed version to Github via the command line. 
    
####Lessons Learned     
   
The main lesson for me that come out of the FizzBuzz lesson was the concept of Test Driven Development, and the implications of solid unit tests on the project as a whole. Up until now, I thought the test was if the program worked, I had no concept of pre-specified tests before this lesson.  
     
This exercise also opened the door what is referred to as 'magic' that happens behind the scenes in programs that are used in Software Development. In this case, it was the new syntax used within the spec file, and the way RSpec moves between files to run it's tests. The lesson was: *'A perfect knowledge of everything you'll be using is impossible. Some things will have to be taken for granted. At least in the short term.'*
   
I enjoyed this exercise immensely. I was using a number of different programs (GitHub, Sublime, Terminal) to produce something tangible. It added a little bit of confidence that the learning material was 'for' something (ie, it can be put to good use), and was a little less dry that the previous work I'd done to date.
