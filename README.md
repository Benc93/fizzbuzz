fizzbuzz
========

Lesson 1 - Week 1

*Downloaded & installed rspec.
*Built a fizzbuzz program with accompanying rspec file.
*Debugged, and discussed various points and common conventions (eg, hard code the ruby method to initially 'test' the test script)
*Passed an rspec test for the following:
1. if a number is/is not divisible by 3
2. if a number is/is not divisible by 7
*then
3. if a method returns "Fizz" if a number is divisible by 3
4. if a method returns "Buzz" if a number is divisible by 5 
5. if a method returns "FizzBuzz" if a number is divisible by 15
6. if a method returns the original number if it is NOT divisible by 3; 5; or 15.
